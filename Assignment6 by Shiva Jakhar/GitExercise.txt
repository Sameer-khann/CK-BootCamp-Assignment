1. Configure SSH key in github account.

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sameerkhann241@gmail.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" (Start SSH agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (addd  the key)
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (copy key)
(Do the github thing)
ssh -T git@github.com (Test, should dipley "Hi Samir")


2. Create a repository on github account.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "New Project added"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sameer-khann/CK-BootCamp-Assignment.git
git push origin main

3. Clone the above repository on your local from github.

git clone https://github.com/Sameer-khann/CK-BootCamp-Assignment.git

4. Create a new file, say test.txt, in main branch. Make some changes to this file and commit the changes.

git add .
git commit -m "Stable"
git push

5. Create two branches from main branch

git checkout main
git checkout -b newBranch1

git checkout main
git checkout -b newBranch2

git branch newBranchName

6. How can you resolve a merge conflict in Git, provide an example.

git merge {Anoter banch's name}

7. Show how divergence occurs in a branch.

git fetch origin
git rebase origin/{Bramch name}
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin main --force-with-lease

8. Difference between git init and git clone.

git init use to initialize a new empty repository.
git clone used to clone an existing repo and override if anything earlier present in file.

9. Difference between git branch and git checkout.

git branch is use to see all the branches, or create a new branch.
git branch newBranchName

git checkout is used to switch the branch within our system, it is also used to create a branch and immediatly switch on it.

10. Difference between git fetch and git pull.

git fetch just bring the latest changes on remote branch but it doesn't merge it into our existing code, giving us vhance to compare what's coming from remote.

git pull is the combination of git fetch + git merge. It fetches the branch from remote and merge it too. And give us conflict (if any).

11. How to squash commits?

git log --oneline
git rebase -i HEAD~2
git push origin main --force

12. Show the difference between git reset and git revert.

git reset point the HEAD to the desired commit, but remives the intermediate commit.

While git revert do the same but also keep the track of all the commit(Don't loose any commit)

13. Delete branch from local and remote.

-> switch to some other branch 
git branch -d newBranchName (remove from local)

git push origin --delete newBranchName
