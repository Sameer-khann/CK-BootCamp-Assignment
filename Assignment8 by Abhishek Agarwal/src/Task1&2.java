//1. What is the Java Collections Framework? Explain its advantages.
//
//The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces in Java that helps you store, manage, and manipulate groups of objects (called collections).
//
//It provides data structures like List, Set, Map, and Queue.
//The main advantages are dynamic sizing, reusability, and consistency across all collections.
// For example, ArrayList is a resizable array, HashSet is used for unique elements, and HashMap stores key-value pairs.
//

// 2. List the differences between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet.
//
//
//ArrayList and Vector both use dynamic arrays, but Vector is synchronized and slower.
//LinkedList uses a doubly linked list, making insertion and deletion faster but access slower.
//HashSet uses hashing to store unique elements without maintaining order.
//So, we choose ArrayList for random access, LinkedList for frequent insertions, and HashSet for uniqueness.
//
//Vector increase it's size by 100% when it's full while ArrayList increase it's size by 50% only.
